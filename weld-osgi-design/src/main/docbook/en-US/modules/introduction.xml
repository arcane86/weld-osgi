        Weld-OSGi aims at simplifying the access to the OSGi environment by
        providing a more modern, more user-friendly and faster way to
        interact with the OSGi Framework.
        It adresses the OSGi complexity of services management using CDI
        specification (JSR-299). Thus it provides an CDI-OSGi extension with
        injection utilities for the OSGi environment.
        Moreover an integration with any CDI implementation, such as Weld,
        is possible through a standard bootstrapping API.
