        <title>What is Weld-OSGi ?</title>
        <para>
            Weld-OSGi aims at simplifying the access to the OSGi environment
            by providing a more modern, more user-friendly and faster way to
            interact with the OSGi Framework.
            It addresses the OSGi complexity of services management using CDI
            specification (JSR-299). Thus it provides an CDI-OSGi extension
            with injection utilities for the OSGi environment.
            Moreover an integration with any CDI implementation, such as Weld,
            is possible through a standard bootstrapping API.
