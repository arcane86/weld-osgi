            <title>Bean archive</title>
            <para>
                A bean archive is a java archive, such as a jar or a Java EE
                module, that contains a special marker file:
                <code>META-INF/bean.xml</code>.
            </para>
            <para>
                A bean archive may be deploy in a CDI environment. It enables
                all CDI functionality in that bean archive.

            <title>OSGi bundle</title>
            <para>
                A bundle is a Java archive, such as a jar or a folder,
                that contains a special marker file: <code>META-INF/Manifest
                .MF</code>.
            </para>
            <para>
                A bundle may be deploy in an OSGi environment. It enables
                all OSGi functionality for that bundle.
            </para>

            <title>Bean bundle</title>
            <para>
                A bean bundle is a java archive that contains both special
                marker file: <code>META-INF/bean.xml</code> and
                <code>META-INF/Manifest.MF</code>.
            </para>
            <para>
                A bean bundle may be deploy in an OSGi environment using
                Weld-OSGi infrastructure bundle. It enables both OSGi and CDI
                functionality for that bundle. It also enables Weld-OSGi
                special functionality.
            </para>

            <title>Infrastructure bundle</title>
            <para>
                The infrastructure bundle is a bean bundle that manage all
                the other bean bundle of the current OSGi application. It
                manage all CDI relevant functionality and communication.

            <title>References</title>
            <para>
                This document uses both CDI and OSGi specification
                documentations as technical references. You may refer to these
                documents for a better understanding of CDI and OSGi
                functionality, references and naming conventions.

        <title>What is Weld-OSGi ?</title>
        <para>
            Weld-OSGi aims at simplifying the access to the OSGi environment
            by providing a more modern, more user-friendly and faster way to
            interact with the OSGi Framework.
        </para>
        <para>
            It addresses the OSGi complexity about services management using CDI
            specification (JSR-299). Thus it provides an CDI OSGi extension
            with injection utilities for the OSGi environment.
        </para>
        <para>
            Moreover an integration with any CDI implementation, such as Weld,
            is possible through a standard bootstrapping API. An complete
            integration with Weld is provided.
        </para>

        <title>What about other frameworks</title>
        <para>
            Weld-OSGi stays compliant with CDI specification and uses only
            standard OSGi mechanisms. Every things it does (or nothing from
            it) CDI and OGSi can do.
        </para>
        <para>
            Thereby is compatible with most of the current frameworks dealing
            with OSGi service management.
