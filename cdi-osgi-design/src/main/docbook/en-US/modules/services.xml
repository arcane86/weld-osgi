        <title>Dealing with OSGi services and CDI</title>
        <para>
            The main characteristic of Weld-OSGi is to provide an easy way to
            deal with OSGi service exposure and consumption. Here we present the
            possibilities of Weld-OSGi on this point.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>Common OSGi services versus injectable services</title>
            <para>
                Because your future applications might use classic OSGi bundles
                as well as CDI ready bundles you should wondering what the
                difference between a classic OSGi service and an injectable
                service. And also if they are compatible.
            </para>
            <para>
                Be at ease, there very few differences between the two and they
                are fully compatible. Both of them uses the same OSGi service
                registry system. Thus you can inject a classic OSGi service or
                use a service published using Weld-OSGi in an classic bundle.
                But it is much more simple to publish and consume services using
                Weld-OSGi way.

        <title>Service consuming</title>
        <para>
            There several ways to use a published service using Weld-OSGi.
            Let's assume a service exposed through an interface :
            <programlisting>
                public interface MyService {
                    void doSomething();
                }
            </programlisting>
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>The @OSGiService annotation</title>
            <para>
                This the most simple way to obtain a service. This annotation
                is only a qualifier that designate a OSGi service injection
                point.
            </para>
            <para>
                When the CDI container performs an injection on this
                injection point it looks for a matching instance in the list
                of registered services. Then it returns the first matching
                instance.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can use it like that :
                <programlisting>
                    @Inject @OSGiService MyService service;
                    service.doSomething();
                </programlisting>
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The parametrized Service interface</title>
            <para>
                This interface acts like a service provider. Then you can
                test availability of the service before use it.
                You can use it like that:
                <programlisting>
                    @Inject Service&lt;MyService&gt; service;
                    if (service.isAvailable()) {
                        service.get().doSomething();
                    }
                </programlisting>
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The parametrized Services interface</title>
            <para>
                This interface permit to obtain all the matching instance of
                a service. It is an iterable list of injected instance of
                service like those got using the @OSGiService annotation.
                You can use it like that:
                <programlisting>
                    @Inject Services&lt;MyService&gt; services;
                    if (service.size() &gt; 0) {
                        for (MyService service : services) {
                            service.doSomething();
                        }
                    }
                </programlisting>
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The parametrized ServiceProviders interface</title>
            <para>
                This interface permit to obtain all the matching service
                provider of a service. It is an iterable list of service
                providers like those you got using the Service interface.
                You can use it like that :
                <programlisting>
                    @Inject ServiceProviders&lt;MyService&gt; services;
                    if (service.size() &gt; 0) {
                        for (Service&lt;MyService&gt; service : services) {
                            if (service.isAvailable()) {
                                service.get().doSomething();
                            }
                        }
                    }

            <title>The OSGiServiceUnavailableException exception</title>
            <para>
                If a service is unavailable at the time of a service call a
                <code>OSGiServiceUnavailableException</code> is thrown.

        <title>Service publishing</title>
        <para>
            There is an easy to publish service with Weld-OSGi: you just mark
            the class you want to become a service. Everything else is handled
            by Weld-OSGi.
        </para>
        <para>
            The registration occurs right after the CDI container startup and
            register all the discovered services in the OSGi service
            registering system.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>The @Publish annotation</title>
            <para>
                In order to mark a class as a publishable service it may be
                annotated by @Publish.
                You can use it like that:
                <programlisting>
                    @Publish
                    @ApplicationScoped
                    public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
                        @Override
                        public void doSomething() {
                        }
                    }
